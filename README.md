# Vim Dot File

This is my vim dot file. There are many like it, but this one is mine. There are a couple of requirements, which are included in the instruction below.

## Requirements

You will need to ensure that your version of Vim is at least 7.3.584 and that it has support for python2 scripting. The best way to do this is by following the YouCompleteMe  [installation instructions](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe#full-installation-guide).

If you're installing on a Mac, the simplest way to do this is by installing MacVim with [homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew update
brew install macvim
```

After MacVim has successfully installed, open up your `.bashrc` file and create an alias pointing `vim` at MacVim binary.

```bash
alias vim='/Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim'
```


## Installation

#### 1. Clone Repo

After you have your Vim installation sorted, clone this repo to your home directory as a folder named `.vim`

```bash
cd ~/
git clone git@github.com:aaronmoodie/vimdotfile.git ./.vim
```

Now we'll need to create links to `.vim/vimrc` and `.vim/gvimrc` so that Vim and MacVim can find them.

```bash
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
```

#### 2. Install Plugins

[Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) is used to manage plugin installation and removal. To install all the plugins as part of this dot file, open up Vim, and run the command `:PlunginInstall`. This should run Vundle and install all the plugins listed in the `.vim/vimrc` file.

#### 3. Compile YouCompleteMe

YouCompleteMe is an amazing auto complete plugin, and requires an additional step for installation. The best thing to do is follow the *compiling instructions* on the YouCompleteMe [Github page](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe#installation) for your specific environment.

#### 4. Install TheSilverSearcher

I use The Silver Search's `ag` command as a replacement for `grep`. Visit the [Github page](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher#installing) for installation instructions for your specific environment.

If you're on Mac, we can easily install this with homebrew `brew install the_silver_searcher`.

Here is some [further reading](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/faster-grepping-in-vim) on what Ag is and how it makes you life easier. All these shorcuts have been implimented.

#### 5. Done!

You should now be good to go! The `.vim/vimrc` also lists the what the leader key is, and what shortcuts have been setup. Customize as needed.

Enjoy! üëç
