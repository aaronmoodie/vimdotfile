# Vim Dot File

This is my vim dot file. There are many like it, but this one is mine. Feel free to use and modify it. There are a couple of requirements, which are detailed below.

## Requirements

#### Vundle
I use Vundle to manage all of my Vim plugins. Vundle is great, and you should use it too. Visit the [Vundle Github page](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) for installation instructions.

#### The Silver Searcher
The Silver Search is a replacement for Grep which is lightning fast. You'll need to install The Silver Searcher so that searching in Vim functions correctly. Visit the [Github page](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) for installation instructions.
